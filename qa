  Machine Learning:
  Aims to replicate activities that requrie human cognition
  
  CNNs
  CNNs are convolutional neural networks, these are used for vision.
  
  RNNs
  RNNs are used for typically sequantial data.
  
  ANNs
  
  
  Modern Techniques:
  derivative
  adversarial networks
  
  
  
  
  There is a finite set of rules
  we tend to use large basket of techniques, these are called machine learning models, these are very old models, 
  several of them at least very old. so we will be looking at many of these algorithms.
  
  computational fluid dynamics often abbreviated as CFD
  
  solid mechanics modelling or any continuum based modeling or PDE-based modeling
  
Aims  
To understand basic Machine Learning models thoroughly
TO be familar with some modern ML techniques
To apply these techniques hands-on to problems in Engineering
you will have to learn and program in Python.
We will give you basic rudiments and will give you several basic examples.
Our expectation is that you will also do some home work on your own.
So in terms of prerequisites for the course what is it that your require in order to make that you can complete the course successfully
One of the primary requirement that you would have is mathematical sophistication.     
we will be introducing you to some basic ideas that are required for the course
We will be giving suggested exercises throughout this course

Course Outline:
Course will be in three broad parts
https://nptel.ac.in/courses/106106198/1

History:
1957- Rosenblatt -  Perceptron - Two-layer artifical neural network
rule based systems
organic chemistry models
back propagation
Alpha Go
Go is a game which has simpler rules than just it's known to be combinatorially much more harder to solve.


* What is different this time?
- Better technology
- - Exponentially huge computational power
- - we have GPUs
- - We have all sort of futuristic computational technology that people are proposing
- - We have really really big data

Important portion of the current boom cycle is 
 - democratisation of resources (software and hardware).
 
Google's Tensorflow
Facebook's pie torch
Better Algorithms 

What sort of models will work best is what we are going to look at through this course.
Under what circumstance, If you have a vision pronblem

AI:
==
Any method that tries to replicate the results of some aspect of human cognition.

ML:
====
Programs that performs better with experience.
It is explicitly not rule-based.
Simple definition - Using data to answer questions.
Study of computer algorithms that improve automatially through experience.(means data)
It figures out the rules for itself.

ANN:(Artifical Neural Networks)
===============================
A Machine learning algorithm

Deep Learning:
=============
A type of ANN
It's a particular subset of machine learning itself.

Big Data
========
Using data to find unobvious patterns

The AI Venn diagram (to show the relationship between various terms)
====================
Deep Learning -> Machine Learning - > Artifical Intelligence


AI :
===
Which also encompasses rules-based learning. 

Books:
======
Tom Mitchell "Machine Learning"
Pedro Domingo (multiple sources)
Francois Chollet (Deep learning with python)
Master Algorithm

When is machine learning useful?
================================
When experts are unable to explain their expertise
 - Image recognition
 - Speech recognition
 - Driving a car
 
 Rule of thumb
 =============
 Don't use if rules are concise and clear
 
 
 A Fundamental "trick" in most of ML
 ====================================
 All problems are data, all solutions are functions/maps
 
 For example, whether it is a face recognition problem, spam recognition problem,fluid mechanics problem, whatever it's, every problem can be posted can be posed as a data problem.
 
 1) you have an image, he will not recognise whether it is a cat or dog
 Cognitive tasks - Humans get sensory inputs as qualia (quatitative input)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Combinatorial explosion:
 ========================
 Rules are difficult to extract 
 
 
 When Human expertise does not exist
 - Even for hazardous environments -- It's usually a good idea to use machine learnning or any.
 
 Also when you have solutions that needs to be an adapted to very special cases.
 - User biometrics 
 - Patient specific treatments
