  Machine Learning:
  Aims to replicate activities requring human cognition
  
  There is a finite set of rules
  we tend to use large basket of techniques, these are called machine learning models, these are very old models, 
  several of them at least very old. so we will be looking at many of these algorithms.
  
  computational fluid dynamics often abbreviated as CFD
  
  solid mechanics modelling or any continuum based modeling or PDE-based modeling
