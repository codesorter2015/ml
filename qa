  Machine Learning:
  Aims to replicate activities that requrie human cognition
  
  CNNs
  CNNs are convolutional neural networks, these are used for vision.
  
  RNNs
  RNNs are used for typically sequantial data.
  
  ANNs
  
  
  Modern Techniques:
  derivative
  adversarial networks
  
  
  
  
  There is a finite set of rules
  we tend to use large basket of techniques, these are called machine learning models, these are very old models, 
  several of them at least very old. so we will be looking at many of these algorithms.
  
  computational fluid dynamics often abbreviated as CFD
  
  solid mechanics modelling or any continuum based modeling or PDE-based modeling
  
Aims  
To understand basic Machine Learning models thoroughly
TO be familar with some modern ML techniques
To apply these techniques hands-on to problems in Engineering
you will have to learn and program in Python.
We will give you basic rudiments and will give you several basic examples.
Our expectation is that you will also do some home work on your own.
So in terms of prerequisites for the course what is it that your require in order to make that you can complete the course successfully
One of the primary requirement that you would have is mathematical sophistication.     
we will be introducing you to some basic ideas that are required for the course
We will be giving suggested exercises throughout this course

Course Outline:
Course will be in three broad parts
