What is NLP?
Natural Language Processing is a field of study focused on making sense of language.

Topic Identification?

Text Classification?

NLP Application include:
* Chatbots
* Translation
* Sentiment analysis
and there also many more.

What exactly are regular expressions?
- Strings with a special syntax
- Allow us to match patterns in other strings

Usage:
You can use regular expressions to do things like find all the web links in a document.
Parse email addresses, remove/replace unwanted characters 

Example:
common regex patterns
\w+ Matches - word 
\d Matches - digit
\s Matches - space
.* Matches - wildcard
+ or * Matches - greedy match
\S Matches - not space
[a-z] Matches - lowercase group

Pattern:
A pattern is a series of letters or symbols which can map to an actual text or words or punctuation.                              

Python's re Module
==================
re modules
--------------
Split: Split a string on regex
Findall: Find all patterns in a string
Search: Search for a pattern
Match: Match an entire string or substring based on a pattern
Pattern first and the string second
May return an iterator, string or match object
In [5]: re.split('\s+', 'Split on spaces.')
Out[5]: ['Split', 'on', 'spaces.']

What is tokenization?
=====================
Turning a string or document into tokens (smaller chunks)
Many different theories and rules
You can create your own rules using regular expressions.
Ex:
nlkt library
nlkt: natural language toolkit
from nlkt.tokenize import word_tokenize
word_tokenize("hi there")
Example:
In [1]: from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
In [2]: word_tokenize("Hi there!")
Out[2]: ['Hi','there','!']

Why tokenize?
=============
- Easier to map part of speech.
- Matching common words
- Removing unwanted tokens
